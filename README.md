## 🚀 Features

In Sensei32, every pin of ESP32 has been brought to the board perimeter through castellated holes, so that the user can decide to:

- Solder the provided **18650 battery holder** and pin-headers, using Sensei32 as a standard ESP32 DevKit, ready for your battery-operated DIY projects.
- Solder Sensei32 to a custom carrier PCB, using Sensei32 as a feature-packed ESP32 module, with **any Li-Ion or Li-Poly external battery** (up to 6000mAh).

Sensei32 has **world-class ULP performance**, consuming about **21uA in deep-sleep** while providing a **stable and regulated 3.3V** over the whole voltage range of a single cell Li-Ion. The integrated sensors for Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Air Quality (**BME688**, AI Powered) and precision temperature and humidity (**HDC1080**) provide an exceptional environmental sensing ability.

## 🤖 Tech

The WiFi Air Quality Station firmware acquires 12 measures every hour (one measure every 5minutes, 300s) from the integrated Texas Instruments HDC1080 Temperature and Humidity sensor and the integrated Bosh BME688 Temperature, Humidity, Presssure and Air Quality sensor. Each hour, the mean value of the 12 past measurments is computed and trasmitted over WiFi to [Thingspeak][tspeak] for data logging and representation. The firmware embeds an algorithm that, leveraging from a NTP time sample every hour, keep the Sensei32 wake-up time in sync with global time.

We are looking forward to **reach 1 year of battery life** thanks to the **optimised Sensei32 (Ver.001 Rev.002) Hardware Design** and **Firmware**. Check out the **3D-Print_Case** folder and print your own **Sensei32 Stand-Alone** case!

Sensei32 is designed around the **ESP32 WROOM**, a battery charger (**BQ24092**) and ultra-low power regulator (**TPS63900**) ICs. The choice of these devices provide a particularly stable 3.3V over the whole voltage range of a single cell Li-Ion, enabling the operation until the battery reaches the discharge threshold. The integrated sensors for Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Air Quality (**BME688**, AI Powered) and precision temperature and humidity (**HDC1080**) provide an exceptional environmental sensing ability.

The **USB Micro AB** connector is used for both charging and programming, as data lines are routed to an original **FT231XQ-R** USB-serial chip, which is supplied with power only by the 5V USB-VBus line, thus avoiding unnecessary battery usage when not programming or charging. This unique feature enables a 5V power source to keep the battery replenished whilst consuming ultra-low power.  

Sensei32 shares the same form-factor (every mechanical feature including button placement) and pinout of [WEMOS ESP32 Board with 18650 Battery Holder][WEMOS], representing a drag & drop replacement for every project that is already using this very common board, but with a far better ULP performance, components quality and integrated sensors. Sensei32 also has two extra pins on the right-side connector to break out VBAT (Battery line) and GND, enabling the use of any external Li-Ion or Li-Poly battery (up to 6000mAh). The Sensei32 also has an in-built battery monitoring facilities, together with an NTC resistor that is used to monitor battery and battery charger temperatures. The **NTC resistor is not reachable from the ESP32**, as it is dedicated to the BQ24092 battery charger.

While the power architecture of Sensei32 can operate with VBAT voltages (Battery line) exceeding the [2.6V, 4.2V] operational range, it's recommended to stay between the limits specified by the Li-Ion or Li-Poly battery manufaturer and always use Li-Ion or Li-Poly batteries from a trusty manufacturer, like a Samsung INR18650-30Q and/or a INR18650-35E cell.

> To avoid any operating interference with the ESP32 Internal Flash, Sensei32 **do not** break out ESP32 Internal Flash QSPI Pins.
> To ensure this does not happen, **In place of** IO6 (FLASH_SCK), IO7 (FLASH_D0), IO8 (FLASH_D1), IO9 (FLASH_D2), IO10 (FLASH_D3), IO11 (FLASH_CMD) **Sensei32 has GND Pins**.

## 🚦 Compiling the sketch with Arduino

### 1. Install the latest Arduino IDE and ESP32 BSP

As of this publication, the latest Arduino IDE 1.8.13 can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php). In order to compile the Sensei32 Starter Package, the ESP32 Arduino Board Support Package should be already installed from "Tools > Board Manager". There are plenty of guides online that show how to install and use an ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE, as a reference: [How to install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE][arduesp]. 

Once installed the ESP32 Arduino Board Support Package, Sensei32 Arduino board configuration should match the following:

| Configuration | Setting |
| ------ | ------ |
| Board | ESP32 Wrover Module |
| Upload Speed | 921600 |
| Flash Frequency | 80MHz |
| Flash Mode | QIO |
| Partition Scheme | Default 4MB with spiffs |

### 2. Install basic libraries

Sensei32 can be used with most third-party library designed for Arduino. In this example, the integrated Texas Instruments HDC1080 Temperature and Humidity sensor and the integrated Bosh BME688 Temperature, Humidity, Presssure and Air Quality sensor are read using standard libraries, that can be easily downloaded from the Arduino Library Manager:
- HDC1080 Library from ClosedCube, [Library Github][CCube]
- BME680 Library form Adafruit, [Library Github][AdaBME]

From Adafruit Library Git: "The BME680 takes those sensors to the next step in that it contains a small MOX sensor. The heated metal oxide changes resistance based on the volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air, so it can be used to detect gasses & alcohols such as Ethanol, Alcohol and Carbon Monoxide, and perform air quality measurements. Note it will give you **one resistance value**, with overall VOC content, but it cannot differentiate gasses or alcohols."

### 3. Configure the sketch

Firstly, go to the network configuration header file "network_credentials.h" and edit wifi and ThingSpeak settings.
To use ThingSpeak, sign up for a free developer account at [ThingSpeak][TSup].

> // Change to your WiFi credentials         \
> const char* ssid        = "YOUR_SSID";     \
> const char* password    = "YOUR_PASSWORD"; \
> // Change to your TS Write API Key         \
> String ts_apikey        = "YOUR_API_KEY";  

Next, configure the firmware "Sensei32-WiFi_AirQuality_Basic.ino" to your needs:

a) Usage of the integrated board LED to indicate activity

> // Define to avoid the usage of the Board LED - POWER SAVING \
> #define USE_BOARD_LED

b) Usage of a fake battery voltage (only for DEBUG)

> // Define to ignore the battery voltage - DEBUG ONLY   \
> //#define FAKE_BATTERY 

c) Usage of ThingSpeak to upload sensor and battery data

> // Define to avoid pushing data to ThingSpeak - DEBUG ONLY   \
> #define PushToThingSpeak

The following table recap the field configured for the ThingSpeak push event

| ThingSpeak Field | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Field 1 | Temperature [°C] |
| Field 2 | Humidity [%RH] |
| Field 3 | Pressure [hPa] |
| Field 4 | GasResistance [Ohm] |
| Field 5 | BatteryVoltage [V] |

### 4. You are ready to go!

Just upload the firmware to your Sensei32 board and enjoy!
